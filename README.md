## Criteria

 As a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.
 Given a command-line application that accepts user input,
 
- When I am prompted for my team members and their information then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
- When I click on an email address in the HTML then my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.
- When I click on the GitHub username then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
- When I start the application then I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
- When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number then I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.
- When I select the engineer option then I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.
- When I select the intern option then I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.
- When I decide to finish building my team then I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
